    "This page contains tutorials showing how to use Nix and Nixpkgs. The tutorials were written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) so they can be used interactively. \n",

    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a document that, aside from text and figures can also contain interactive content and code. \n",
    "A notebook consists of cells and each cell has a type, e.g. code or markup. \n",
    "Code cells, when executed, can generate output. The output is recorded in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How about the static website?\n",
    "Now, the static website is generated by simply evaluating the notebooks and converting input and output to html. \n",
    "The interactive tutorials on the other hand are actual notebooks that are provisioned using Binder. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I use these tutorials interactively?\n",
    "Every tutorial on this page, including this one, has a \"launch binder\" button at the top. \n",
    "Press it, and after some time (it typically takes 10 seconds or more) a notebook is opened and you see the tutorial, minus output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a cell, select a cell and press the \"Run\" button at the top. We can test this with the following cell"
